    <h3>Basketball</h3>
    <p>My favorite sport of all time is <strong>basketball</strong>. Growing up I have played a variety of sports
       ranging from soccer to wrestling. Although I thorooughly enjoyed my time be on these teams
       and developing my skills in these sports, nothing has made me feel the way I feel about basketball.
       My brother, Amos, was the one who got me interested in the game. Years ago, we were on the couch with
       another friend and at school we heard that the 2008 NBA Finals were going on. After putting on the game
       all three of us were instantly hooked. The flashy maneuvers and the swift scorers amazed me. The next day
       I asked my dad if I could start playing basketball myself and was finally able to join a team. Now that I'm
       in college I have been able to enjoy basketball by myself but with others. This sport has allowed me to have
       a closer relationship with my brother and meet new people whenever I'm on the court. Also, even though I have
       never played for a high school or college team, I enjoy playing recreationally and expand my skillset.
