    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p>My journey into <strong>photography</strong> has been truly inspiring. It all started from a school competition where I had to make
       do with my mom&apos;s phone, and now I&apos;m running my own Instagram account. This shows my dedication and passion for this
       art form.Participating in the Technology Student Association (TSA) was a great learning curve. Placing third out of 50
       participants was no small feat, especially considering I achieved this with limited resources. This experience not only
       gave me exposure but also instilled in me the confidence to pursue photography more seriously. Years later, I&apos;ve reignited
       this passion and am sharing my work with the world through my Instagram account, @aaronrochephoto. This step is a testament
       to my growth as a photographer. Instagram has proven to be a great platform for artists like me to showcase our work, gain
       recognition, and also learn from the community. As I continue on this path, I remember that every picture I take is an opportunity
       to tell a story, to capture a moment that speaks to people. I keep exploring, capturing, and sharing. My journey is just beginning
       and the world is waiting to see through my lens.
