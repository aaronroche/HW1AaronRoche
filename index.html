    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>General Info</h3>
    <p>My name is Aaron Roche and I am currently majoring in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
       My current hobbies include photography, playing basketball, skiing, and hanging out with friends. To prepare myself
       for my future career as a Software Engineer or Developer, I have worked on various personal projects such as a web
       scraper using the Spotify API, and have also interned at Fidelity Investments as a Full Stack Software Engineer. Although
       I haven't had too much experience with developing my projects and applications, I still enjoy learning new concepts about
       Computer Science and hope to work on more projects that I become passionate about in the future. During this class, I want
       to develop my skills as a Web Developer so that I can apply what I learn to my work or even to jobs I end up getting later on.
       I have always liked the UI aspect of development and will do my best in this class to work towards creating a satisfying experience
       for people who see my web pages.
